# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the programming language R to solve archaeological problems. Specifically, we will show how to manage R projects, load in archaeological data, do descriptive statistics and plot data in different ways.

We assume you have already installed R and RStudio, if you haven't, please do so now. You can download R here: <https://cran.r-project.org/>. RStudio is found here: <https://posit.co/downloads/>

If you want to learn more basis aspects or R, you can try, for example, this course: <https://www.w3schools.com/R/default.asp>.
