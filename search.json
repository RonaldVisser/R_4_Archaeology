    "text": "So now we have the two tables stored in variables separately, but to be able to do analyses using information from both, we need to join them. We can do this with the inner_join() function:\n\n# join 2 tables on column VONDSTNR\nfinds_total <- inner_join(finds, bag_contents, by =\"VONDSTNR\")\n\nThis function takes the first two arguments (finds & bag_contents) and joins them together where VONDSTNR (find number) is the same in both tables. Now have a look in the Environment tab, you should see a finds_total variable, open it in table view to check the data has been merged successfully.\nNow we have all the data in one variable, we can very easily do some basic descriptive statistics on this table by using the summary() function:\n\n# display basic statistics for variable 'finds_total'\nsummary(finds_total)\n\n  OPGR_ID.x             PUTNR           VLAKNR           VAKNR      \n Length:1374        Min.   : 1.00   Min.   :  1.00   Min.   :  1.0  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:13.00   1st Qu.:  1.00   1st Qu.:103.0  \n Mode  :character   Median :16.00   Median :  1.00   Median :108.0  \n                    Mean   :17.21   Mean   :  1.55   Mean   :149.2  \n                    3rd Qu.:23.00   3rd Qu.:  1.00   3rd Qu.:204.0  \n                    Max.   :99.00   Max.   :104.00   Max.   :305.0  \n                                                     NA's   :922    \n    SPOORNR       VULLINGNR      SEGMENTNR         VONDSTNR     \n Min.   :   1   Min.   : 1.000   Mode:logical   Min.   :   1.0  \n 1st Qu.:  39   1st Qu.: 1.000   NA's:1374      1st Qu.: 220.2  \n Median :  89   Median : 1.000                  Median : 472.5  \n Mean   :1018   Mean   : 1.067                  Mean   : 531.6  \n 3rd Qu.:3000   3rd Qu.: 1.000                  3rd Qu.: 839.8  \n Max.   :5001   Max.   :11.000                  Max.   :1088.0  \n                NA's   :125                                     \n   INHOUD.x           MONSTER            VERZAMEL          DATUM        \n Length:1374        Length:1374        Length:1374        Mode:logical  \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   NA's:1374     \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character                 \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n OPMERKING.x         INVDATUM.x         OPGR_ID.y           INHOUD.y        \n Length:1374        Length:1374        Length:1374        Length:1374       \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n   ABR_ALG          ABR_SPECSVU            AANTAL           GEWICHT       \n Length:1374        Length:1374        Min.   :  1.000   Min.   :   0.10  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:  1.000   1st Qu.:   6.00  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :  2.000   Median :  14.60  \n                                       Mean   :  4.543   Mean   :  60.56  \n                                       3rd Qu.:  4.000   3rd Qu.:  41.50  \n                                       Max.   :200.000   Max.   :3280.00  \n                                       NA's   :10        NA's   :11       \n     DOOSNR       LOKATIE           BEWAARD.

For numerical data, it will return the min and max value, as well as the mean and median. For text data, it will give you counts for each occurance in that column. So for example, we can see that the mean weight (column GEWICHT) of a finds bag is 60.56 and the maximum finds in one bag is 200 (column AANTAL).\nOf course this could be useful information for some research, but generally we want to do more in depth analysis, such as comparing finds between features. To do this, we first need to group finds by SPOORNR (feature number) and then sum the weight and number of finds.\n\n# group by feature number (SPOORNR) and sum number of finds (AANTAL) and weight (GEWICHT)\nfeature_groups <- group_by(finds_total, SPOORNR)\nfeature_sums <- summarise(feature_groups, \n                          AANTAL = sum(AANTAL), \n                          GEWICHT = sum(GEWICHT))\n\nHere we use the group_by() function to group finds_total by SPOORNR and save it as feature_groups. Then we use summarise() to sum the number of finds (AANTAL) and weight (GEWICHT) in the grouped table, giving us the weight and number of finds per feature (saved in variable feature_sums). In your Environment tab, view feature_sums in table view to see what the data looks like.\nNow we can use the stat.desc() function from the dyplr library to view statistics about specific columns. We give the function the variable plus the column we want statistics for, joined by the dollar sign ( $ ):\n\n# view stats on number of finds (AANTAL) and weight (GEWICHT)\nstat.desc(feature_sums$AANTAL)\n\n     nbr.val     nbr.null       nbr.na          min          max        range \n  152.000000     0.000000     9.000000     1.000000  1363.000000  1362.000000 \n         sum       median         mean      SE.mean CI.mean.0.95          var \n 5759.000000    12.000000    37.888158     9.575449    18.919162 13936.762243 \n     std.dev     coef.var \n  118.054065     3.115857 \n\nstat.desc(feature_sums$GEWICHT)\n\n     nbr.val     nbr.null       nbr.na          min          max        range \n1.510000e+02 0.000000e+00 1.000000e+01 2.200000e+00 1.372781e+04 1.372561e+04 \n         sum       median         mean      SE.mean CI.mean.0.95          var \n7.728261e+04 1.224000e+02 5.118054e+02 1.084921e+02 2.143701e+02 1.777350e+06 \n     std.dev     coef.var \n1.333173e+03 2.604843e+00 \n\n\nIn the output in the Console we can see the sum, median, mean, and so in for both of these columns. For example, the maximum number of finds in a feature is 1363. This gives us some information about the distribution of finds per feature, but it’s much easier to view this sort of information as a graph, which is what we’ll do in the next section.\nAt this point, your code should look something like this:\n\nIf it doesn’t, or if you get any errors, please download this file and copy it into your dawn-course.r file, so you can continue with the next part."

    "text": "Now we know what our tables look like and have some basic statistics, lets make some plots (also known as graphs) to further explore the data. To do this, we first tell ggplot which data we want to use, which column should go on which axis ( ggplot(…) ), and then pass that information (using “+”) to a function that draws a plot ( geom_histogram(…) )\n\n# draw histogram showing counts of AANTAL (number of finds), in bins of 100 (divide data in 100 parts)\nggplot(feature_sums, aes(x=AANTAL)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)\n\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nPut your cursor on the ggplot(…) line, press CTRL + ENTER (or press Run) and you’ll see the histogram displayed in the Plots tab on the bottom right. Click on Zoom to view a bigger version, or press Export to save the plot as an image or PDF.\nSo we can see that the maximum number of finds per features is around 1300 (like we saw in the previous section), but now we can also see that this is an outlier; most features only contain between 0 and 100 finds.\nWe can also draw a boxplot of this data, to further illustrate this point:\n\n# draw boxplot showing counts of AANTAL (number of finds)\nggplot(feature_sums, aes(y=AANTAL)) + geom_boxplot()\n\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows even more clearly that most features contain only a few finds. We can also filter our data to only look at features that contain less than 100 finds, because the high outliers make the rest of the plot hard to read:\n\n# filter data to include only features with 100 or less finds\nfeature_sums_less_than_100 <- filter(feature_sums, AANTAL < 100)\n# then plot histogram and boxplot again\nggplot(feature_sums_less_than_100, aes(x=AANTAL)) +\ngeom_histogram(bins = 100)\n\n\n\nggplot(feature_sums_less_than_100, aes(y=AANTAL)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRunning this code will generate multiple plots, you can use the left and right arrows in the Plots tab to show the previous / next plot.\n\n\nNow we can see that actually, most features only contain between 0 and 25 finds. We can also do the same with weight instead of number of finds:\n\n# plot weight (GEWICHT) for the features that contain less than 100 finds\nggplot(feature_sums_less_than_100, aes(x=GEWICHT)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)\n\n\n\nggplot(feature_sums_less_than_100, aes(y=GEWICHT)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nNow to make it a bit more interesting, we can create separate boxplots for different find categories (ABR_ALG), to see which types of artefacts are found in large or small quantities:\n\n# boxplot per find category (ABR_ALG)\nggplot(finds_total, aes(x=ABR_ALG,y=AANTAL)) + geom_boxplot()\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see that OPX (organic, plantbased) has high numbers of finds per bag on average, while SXX (stone) and MXX (metal) have low numbers of finds.\nWe can also create a barchart showing the number of finds per find category (INHOUD):\n\n# barchart per more specific find category (INHOUD)\nggplot(finds_total, aes(x=INHOUD.y,y=AANTAL)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see that hand-shaped pottery (AWH) is much more prevalent than wheel-thrown pottery (AWG).\nNow let’s look at the number of finds per feature (you might need to Zoom to see properly):\n\n# number of finds per feature\nggplot(finds_total, aes(x=factor(SPOORNR),y=AANTAL)) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can again see that one feature contains over a thousand finds, while the others contain much less. But which proportion of finds is which find category?\n\n# number of finds per feature, stacked bar based on find type (ABR_ALG)\nggplot(finds_total, aes(x=factor(SPOORNR),y=AANTAL, fill = ABR_ALG)) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting, now we see that most features contain pottery (KER), some contain small amounts of stone (SXX) and about 7 features contain noticeable amounts of organic material (OPX/OXX).\nInstead of a stacked barchart, we can also plot each category separately by adding + facet_wrap(~ABR_ALG) to the previous line and removing the fill:\n\n# number of finds per feature, separate bar charts based on find type (ABR_ALG)\nggplot(finds_total, aes(x=factor(SPOORNR),y=AANTAL)) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") + \n  facet_wrap(~ABR_ALG)\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough in this case this is quite hard to read due to the individual plots being too small!\n\n\nNow let’s do the same for weight:\n\n# histogram and boxplot showing distribution of weight over features\nggplot(feature_sums, aes(x=GEWICHT)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\nggplot(feature_sums, aes(y=GEWICHT)) + geom_boxplot()\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n# boxplot and bar chart of weight vs. find categories\nggplot(finds_total, aes(x=ABR_ALG,y=GEWICHT)) + geom_boxplot()\n\nWarning: Removed 11 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\nggplot(finds_total, aes(x=ABR_ALG,y=GEWICHT)) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\nWarning: Removed 11 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these last two plots, we can see that stone (SXX) has a high total weight, even though in our earlier plot of number per category, stone was low in numbers. So we can conclude that stone artefacts have a high weight on average. If we look at the stacked bar chart of weight per feature we see the same phenomenon:\n\n# stacked bar chart of weight per feature, with find category as fill\n\nggplot(finds_total, \n       aes(x=factor(SPOORNR),y=GEWICHT, fill = ABR_ALG)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\nWarning: Removed 11 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also express this relationship between weight and number of finds in a scatter plot:\n\n# add find type to feature sums\nfeature_groups_type <- group_by(finds_total, SPOORNR, ABR_ALG)\nfeature_sums_type <- summarise(feature_groups_type, AANTAL =\nsum(AANTAL), GEWICHT = sum(GEWICHT))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'SPOORNR'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n# plot relationship between weight and quantity, per feature. Colour per find type\n\nggplot(feature_sums_type, \n       aes(x=GEWICHT,y=AANTAL, colour = ABR_ALG)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 1/3)\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph we can see that stone (SXX) tends to be high in weight, but low in number, while organic material (OPX/OXX) is high in number but low in weight.\nInstead of looking at this at the feature level, we can also easily plot this at the trench level by putting the trench number (PUTNR) on the x-axis:\n\n# plot quantities per trench\nggplot(finds_total, aes(x=factor(PUTNR),y=AANTAL)) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\nggplot(finds_total, \n       aes(x=factor(PUTNR),y=AANTAL, fill = ABR_ALG)) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n# plot weight per trench\nggplot(finds_total, aes(x=factor(PUTNR),y=GEWICHT)) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\nWarning: Removed 11 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\nggplot(finds_total, \n       aes(x=factor(PUTNR),y=GEWICHT, fill = ABR_ALG)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\n\nWarning: Removed 11 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of looking at the number or the weight of finds we can also look at the relation of the two. This is done by dividing the total weight per feature by the number of sherds. This is called the break_index below. We can plot this in a histogram.\n\n# fragmentation per feature\nfeature_sums_break <- mutate(feature_sums, break_index = GEWICHT / AANTAL)\nggplot(feature_sums_break, aes(x=break_index)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)\n\nWarning: Removed 10 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt becomes clear that we have some extremes and therefore need to filter the extremes out. We continue our analysis with the smaller break_indices (< 100). We have used histograms so far. However, histograms have a very big disadvantage and that is that they are dependent on the size and startpoint of bins. Kernel Density Estimation is much more flexible and robust (see also this paper from 1996: http://www.archcalc.cnr.it/indice/PDF7/33_Baxter_Beardah.pdf ). See and compare these two for yourself. You can also make the for the other data you’ve analysed in the sections above.\n\nfeature_sums_break_idx100 <- filter(feature_sums_break, break_index < 100)\nggplot(feature_sums_break_idx100, aes(x=break_index)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 100)\n\n\n\nggplot(feature_sums_break_idx100, aes(x=break_index)) + \n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, if you’ve run into any errors or problems, you can download and copy this file to get a working script.\nThere is a feature with and extreme amount of finds. This is feature (SPOORNR) 3000. Try to make a barplot with the number and weight of finds in the feature.\nAt this point you are welcome to try plotting other types of data or relationships.\nTry and use the examples above to create your own analyses.\nStart playing in R!"

    "text": "In this tutorial, you will be using RStudio , a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R. RStudio makes programming in R easier and quicker. Working in a project also automatically sets the working directory, something you have to do manually when writing R scripts outside of projects. The first step to start work on a new script or analysis is to open Rstudio, and then create a project.\n\n\nRStudio projects are associated with R working directories. You can create an RStudio project:\n\nIn a brand new directory\nIn an existing directory where you already have R code and data\nAdvanced: by cloning a version control (Git or Subversion) repository\n\nWe will create a project in a new directory. To do this, use the Create Project command on the toolbar, or go to File > New Project.\nThen select New Directory > New Project, and fill in a Directory Name (this is the name of your project, we will use “dawn-course” for this tutorial). Then click on Browse to select in which directory you want the project to live (your desktop is ok for now).\nWhen a new project is created in RStudio, this:\n\nCreates a project file (with an .Rproj extension) within the project directory. This file contains various project options and can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the filesystem.\nCreates a hidden directory (named .Rproj.user) where project-specific temporary files (e.g. auto-saved source documents, window-state, etc.) are stored. This directory is also automatically added to .Rbuildignore, .gitignore, etc. if required.\nLoads the project into RStudio and display its name in the Projects toolbar (which is located on the far right side of the main toolbar).\n\n\n\n\nNo actual R file has been created yet though, so go to File > New File > R Script (or press CTRL + SHIFT + N).\nTip : Wherever we use the button CTRL, replace this with the CMD button (⌘) on Mac systems. A full list of shortcuts can be found here . This creates an empty, untitled R script. Now enter:\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\nIn the top left area and click the save button or press CTRL + S to save the file.\nEnter a name for the file, generally you would give this file the same name as the project, but with “.r” after it (so “dawn-course.r” if you followed our example above). Now to run our program, press CTRL + SHIFT + S or press the “Source” button.\nThis will run the entire script and output “Hello World!” to the Console screen under your script. Congratulations, you’ve run your first R script in Rstudio!"
